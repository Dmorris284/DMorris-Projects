   	  <p>My name is David Morris; I am an 18 year old student who is  currently studying at the west Cheshire College in Ellesmere Port in England. I  was born in Stoke - on - Trent in England and I have lived here my entire life.  I have a great interest in science and computing, as they were the subjects  that I took to my GCSE's and A level's. I have also gone to college to study  Software Development and I wish to go to University to continue studying in  this field. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I do a small amount of volunteering at my local library  running various clubs and events when they appear. And I have had multiple  places of work experience when I was in Full Time education. I have also participated  in sports during my time in school, as I used to play Rugby for my School team. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
I  have a particular interest for Movies and Books of a Science Fictional nature, I  play computer games and I have like for all things science fiction and fantasy  related. </section>
